BryceBot Data Backends
======================
These are scripts that fetch, massage, and return data for several
BryceBot functions. Nothing exciting...

Notes
=====
* call.php pulls from /tmp/ on the IRC bot host
  This will need to be re-implemented.
* Most of the scripts use curl in order to set connection parameters.
  This may or may not be permitted in GAE. Reimplementing these using
  PHP's stream_() methods will lose the connection re-use parameters.
